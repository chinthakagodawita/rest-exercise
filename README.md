rest-exercise
=============

A simple REST exercise in PHP using the Slim framework.

To use, make sure you copy `default.settings.php` to `settings.php` and configure the settings accordingly.

All routes are available under '_web/index.php_'. For ease-of-use you may wish to setup a virtual host that points to /web.

E.g. to GET all users:
http://<my-site>/web/index.php/api/users
